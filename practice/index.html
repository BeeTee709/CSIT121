    This is one of my first webpages. Once I understood a few of the tags in html the rest seemed to flow freely.
    I dont believe this will be too hard to learn but I will make sure to keep practicing with the tags I have learned.

        Afterall, if I do not practice then, <br><strong>
        I will not learn
        </strong>

            I hope my typing speed increases during this class,
